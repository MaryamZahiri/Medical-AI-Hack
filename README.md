## Inspiration
My journey from being unhealthy to embracing wellness inspired the creation of this project. I realized the importance of health amidst a busy lifestyle filled with work commitments and neglecting personal well-being. This realization motivated me to develop a solution that could help individuals like me prioritize their health even in demanding circumstances.

## What it does
MedAI serves as a comprehensive health management platform. Our AI-powered medical agents analyze lab reports, provide timely medical advice, and track symptoms and calorie intake. Moreover, it incentivizes users to adopt healthier lifestyles by rewarding them with HealthCoins for their commitment to well-being.

## How we built it
We constructed a user-friendly website and integrated it with a powerful AI model to analyze lab reports and address user queries. Leveraging image classification capabilities from ICP, we accurately identify low and high-calorie foods to enhance the precision of our medical advice. Additionally, we utilized Couchbase database to efficiently store and manage patient data.

## Challenges we ran into
We faced challenges finding accessible locations for collaborative work. And connecting with a diverse range of users within a short timeframe posed a challenge.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Developing an AI-based website accessible to users for health management.
- Establishing successful collaborations with Couchbase and ICP.
- Engaging real users to validate and refine our ideas.
## What we learned
- Utilizing ICP models and databases, including Couchbase, for data management.
- Promoting our innovative ideas effectively on social media platforms.
- Implementing creative marketing strategies to highlight the impact of our work.
## What's next for MedAI
- Integration with ICP blockchain to introduce HealthCoin.
- Advancing our project into a commercial venture to empower more individuals to prioritize health and wealth.
